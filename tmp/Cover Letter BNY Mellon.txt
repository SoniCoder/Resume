BNY Mellon

Respected Sir/Madam:

I am interested in the Sr. Application Developer Trainee position at BNY Mellon. I am currently a student at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus graduating in June 2018. I believe that the skills and experiences I have gained here at my campus make me ideal to perform challenging tasks in the real world.

During course of my life, I have developed strong conceptual, technical and logical skills.

I realized that I possed these skills during my internships where I did my best to complete some very interesting projects as mentioned in the resume.

I am always eager to do tasks that require challenge and completing such tasks gives me most satisfaction.

I am confident that my experiences and skills qualify me for consideration. I have also enclosed my resume. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail.

Sincerely,

Hritik Soni
